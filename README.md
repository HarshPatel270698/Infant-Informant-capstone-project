The goal behind creation of this project is to build a portal on which school can relay for everyday administration. Focus of portal was to provide all technical features to a school that can establish a bond between school, professors and parents. I decide to divide this portal in to 3 parts.

1. Infant Informant Dashboard (Desktop Application) 
2. Infant Informant (Android Application)
3. IIFaculty (Android Application)
